version 3.2.6 2014/02/20-

Features:
1. add 'func' support for field format
	E.g. <func args="0;2">substr</func>

===============================================================================


version 3.2.5 2013/12/11

Features:
1. add model debug level control in the code
	add debug levels: debug, info, warning, error, critical
2. add support to merge from 'tmp/' directory directly
3. add 'split' and 'findAll' in regular parsing, including formatter and regexparser


Bugs:
1. fmtName is like 'CACHE_MISS' in map's output will make merge failed
	FIX: replace split '_' to ':'
2. merge fails when map output has child average output
	RC: parse map head fails
3. invalid file header of the map output's child output when it's the last log field of the log line
	RC: log line doesn't get stripped before parsing when using multiple cores
4. sometimes processes exit before merging
	#defensive fix
	using feature 2: merge from 'tmp/' directly, since the 'tmp/' is complete even the bug happens
5. RawOutputHelper cannot support merge
6. only needs list the log files not walk all files recursively in log directory
7. one more out lines in output file when pace is -1
	RC: when is empty, the sampler flush still
	FIX: no flush_cb when is empty
8. for XactRateAnalyser, no anly_negative_pace function when pace is -1
9. when merging directly from tmp/, if may not sort right when the analyser has no inter-count
	FIX: add anlyId support to identy each analyser by sequence
10. merge not work for RawOutputHelper
11. [FATAL] in sampler, when flush the second list, it is always empty
	RC: wrong assignment to set the second sample count to the current list
	FIX: give the right assignment
12. in XactRateAnalyser, it's wrong when using multiple processes optimization
	RC: forget to multiple the pace when decoding
	FIX: multiple the pace
13. the logparser cannot work after the debug level feature
	RC: old version python does not support funcname in log format
14. merging directly from tmp/ fails when using different core numbers

===============================================================================


version 3.2.4 2013/12/03
Features:
1. add block value support, like ifblock
2. add filters support for the conditions of the ifblock
3. add support sorting for map output, when the pace is -1
4. add 'lowercase' and 'uppercase' type in the field in the formatter


Bugs:
1. try first parse the file time from the file name in case the disorder of the translog
2. fmtName is like 'CACHE_MISS' in map's output will make merge failed
	#TODO

===============================================================================


version 3.2.3 2013/10/18

Features:
1. add filter analyser support
	only output the results into stdout
2. add common format support
3. support re-format the log fields
	with the <formatter> element
4. support regex log type
	by setting the log regex format and with the help of the feature 3, we can parse any type of logs now
5. support regex format the log fields
	in the <formatter>, we can use the regex to retrieve any part of the log fields and set them as the new fields with the given fmtNames

Bugs:
1. fix the bug that parsing failure for webengine abr
2. fix the bug that parsing failure when there are spaces in the fields
	convert the spaces in the fields to '|'
3. fix the bug that it fails to give the regex format as argument directly
	add support for short name format file as '-s' option
4. the joint point values are not correct for the average helper in merging
	output the count meantime so it can recover the original total value
5. merge activeSessions wrong
	defencive fix: disable optimization for merging
6. bandwidth and activeSessions not acurate
	for bandwidth, modify the standord bandwidth analyser, which is ok now. But for the customized timeAverage, it cannot be modified based on current framework;
	for activeSessions, it's acurate, no need to change
7. fix the bug that the sampler flush from the 1969 year when merging

===============================================================================


version 3.2.2

Bugs:
1. merge point value not right for bandwidth analyser with pace 10
	RC: minTime control in the sampler should be aligned to the pace

===============================================================================


version 3.2.1

Enhancements:
1. using multiple processes to optimize the merge procedure

Bugs:
1. when the seg output file size is 0, it may crash
2. fix some problems when running in python 2.4
3. crash when there is only one output in the outputs element
4. crash when running in python 2.4 without set the <num cores>

===============================================================================


version 3.2

Features:
1. add outPath element in config file
2. reconstruct the AnalyserHelper code, support all analyser types to be realized with output
3. support not singleType value in output
4. support sub-outputs in map output
5. optimize tool running speed with multiple processes

Bugs:
1. some tokens of webengine have not been defined with the right parse functions
2. error output file not closed
3. error output file no need to be created when there is no errorlog

===============================================================================
