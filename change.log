version 3.2.3 2013/10/18

Features:
1. add filter analyser support
	only output the results into stdout
2. add common format support
3. support re-format the log fields
	with the <formatter> element
4. support regex log type
	by setting the log regex format and with the help of the feature 3, we can parse any type of logs now
5. support regex format the log fields
	in the <formatter>, we can use the regex to retrieve any part of the log fields and set them as the new fields with the given fmtNames

Bugs:
1. fix the bug that parsing failure for webengine abr
2. fix the bug that parsing failure when there are spaces in the fields
	convert the spaces in the fields to '|'
3. fix the bug that it fails to give the regex format as argument directly
	add support for short name format file as '-s' option
4. the joint point values are not correct for the average helper in merging
	output the count meantime so it can recover the original total value
5. merge activeSessions wrong
	defencive fix: disable optimization for merging
6. bandwidth and activeSessions not acurate
	for bandwidth, modify the standord bandwidth analyser, which is ok now. But for the customized timeAverage, it cannot be modified based on current framework;
	for activeSessions, it's acurate, no need to change
7. fix the bug that the sampler flush from the 1969 year when merging
